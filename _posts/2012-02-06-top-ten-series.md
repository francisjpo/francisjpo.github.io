TV series are at their best. They have more time to develop the plot and Internet is the medium they needed to expand. Now the best actors move from theaters to our homes, largely due to broadcasters such as HBO or BBC.

I have a special liking for British series. They focus on quality plots, sometimes forget happy endings and move audience rates away. So my list — in no special order — is:

1. Sherlock (BBC, 2010)
1. Spooks (BBC, 2002)
1. Whitechapel (ITV, 2009)
1. Black Books (BBC, 2000)
1. Bron/Broen (DR & SVT, 2011)
1. Coupling (BBC, 2000)
1. State of Play (BBC, 2003)
1. 24 (Fox, 2001)
1. Band of Brothers (HBO, 2001)
1. Forbrydelsen (DR, 2007)
