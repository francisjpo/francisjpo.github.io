The Talk Show Nerds, this is:
	•	App: Textmate.app
	•	Syntax: MultiMarkdown
	•	Face: mplus-1m-light @ 15pt. Yes: anti aliased. Deal.
	•	Theme: Solarized, by Ethan Schoonover
	•	Soft tabs/4 spaces
	•	Wrap at 78 chars
	•	Soft wrap on
	•	Invisibles on
I'm not a programmer or anything. I just like how this looks. HTH.
How about a break here? That's the breaks.
I Love You™
