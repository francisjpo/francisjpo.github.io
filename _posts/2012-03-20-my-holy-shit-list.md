Rands In Repose from 2002, [Your Holy Shit List](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2002/07/05/your_holy_shit_list.html)

	I’ve starting a HOLY SHIT list. This is list of technologies/software/hardware that blew my mind when I first understood them.

- Digital cameras
- MP3
- HP48
- Internet
- LaTeX2e

[^fn1]: I did not have much exposure to Apple computers until 2000, when I bought my first Mac.
