*Strč prst skrz krk* is a Czech tongue-twister which means "stick your finger through your throat". It has a total absence of vowels and sometimes in the Czech Republic is used as [shibboleth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth) — to judge whether or not a particular person speaks a language or dialect.
