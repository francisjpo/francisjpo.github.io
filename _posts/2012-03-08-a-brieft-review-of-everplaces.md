[Everplaces](http://everplaces.com) is a new location-based service I've been using for the past two months. Unlike Foursquare, Everplaces is not about collecting badges or announcing your Check-ins to all and sundry. It is about creating a fine selection of your most beloved places and sharing with others whithout the whole instant social disruption. Of course, the service has its social features — and sure more to come — but they are frictionless and utterly optional[^fn1]. Thus far, you can't add friends and since your profile is public and you may have private places, you may share your places with everyone in or out of the network.

[^fn1]: Twitter, Facebook, Mail and SMS.

Each Everplace you share shows a card which includes address, images, categories, tags, notes and a location map. People who visit your public profile may now import your places to their own profiles. The developers have recently add a new [Explore](http://everplaces.com/explore) view where you may browse insteresting places from other people. In case you are interested, my [Everplaces profile](http://everplaces.com/francisjpo) has a lot of nice places to browse.


The [Everplaces team](http://everplaces.com/about#team) has also designed an elegant [iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/everplaces/id472735836?ls=1&mt=8) that syncs with the web, so you may look up your *Everplaces*[^fn2] and save new ones — from scratch or using your current GPS position. The app has a **Directions** button which traces the route on Maps application. An Android version of Everplaces is in development.

[^fn2]: The ability to save and access in offline mode to your list is a nice touch.

Everplaces is still a closed beta, only available by [invitation](http://everplaces.com/inviteme/web). It is free for now but hopefully the startup has monetization model in mind and the service keeps improving. The best is yet to come.
