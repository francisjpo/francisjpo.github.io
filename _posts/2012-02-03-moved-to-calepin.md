I am a little tired of using complex blogging systems, plenty of features that I hardly needed. I didn't and don't use that extremely interconnected social layer or widgets, so I have moved to a new and snappy publishing platform. Its name is [Calepin](http://calepin.co) — notebook in French — and works converting your Markdown-formatted files stored in your Dropbox account into posts[^fn1].

The interface is simple, minimal and there is no way to modify it. The publishing process is cleaner and faster than before, as well as its engine is built off of open sourced [Pelican](https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican). Besides, I can write offline whenever I want and transparently synchronize thanks to Dropbox.

By the way, the developer seems very active and has interesting plans to enhance the service which will come in a nearly future — he has recently added custom domain support. Possibly there will be a paid plan, but no details are being offered yet.

So, all I need now is[^fn2]:

- Editor: [TextMate.app](https://macromates.com)
- Syntax: [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)
- Storage: [Dropbox](http://db.tt/1tmJDsw)

Not all I have previously written is going to remain here. Most of them deserve to fall into oblivion in a non-updated cache. There is a [conversion from html to markdown](http://aadm.calepin.co/moving-to-calepin.html) script, but I thought it was a great opportunity to start all over again.

[^fn1]: You can even see the source code of every post changing the URL from .html to .txt.
[^fn2]: A [domain](http://www.namecheap.com?aff=28916) is optional although recommended.
