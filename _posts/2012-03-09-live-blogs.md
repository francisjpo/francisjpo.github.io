Each time Apple hosts a new event I find myself looking up live blogs at the last minute. I don't usually visit the official live stream that Apple provides, when they do, because it is impossible to connect the server. After many years of coverage I have got a selection of blogs that catch all the up-to-the-minute information and have enough bandwidth to deal with all the users.

- [The Verge](http://live.theverge.com)
- [gdgt](http://live.gdgt.com)
- [TUAW](http://tuaw.com)
- [engadget](http://live.engadget.com)
- [Macworld](http://www.macworld.com)
- [MacStories](http://macstories.net)

The Verge and gdgt have loads of photos and more than enough information, but The Verge has pagination. TUAW and Engadget use a nice liveblog system by AOL Tech similar to Cover Flow.
