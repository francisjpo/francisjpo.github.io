For the last six months I've heard a lot of [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) that I decided to drop Google for a few weeks. It's not only I have some concerns about privacy stuff, but I'm a little tired of finding myself watching always the same web pages[^fn1], due to personalized search results. And that's not all. What it really annoys me it's the automatically detected location, which provides more relevant results — supposedly — according to your IP address. For the time being, there is no way to be turned off beyond a shy link at the bottom of the main page.

[^fn1]: Bubbled or [filter bubble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble), concept developed by Eli Pariser.

I feel like trying new things and Duckduckgo is the new search engine on the scene.
